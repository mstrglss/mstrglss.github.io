        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, Iâ€™m Darwin Lopez a current undergraduate student here at the University of California Riverside. Im looking forward to be specialized into Computer Science major. I been through several task done before at my school. Took some classes such as AP Computer Science principals, as well second Year of AP Computer Science Adv in which there were several task that required me to learn Java script. Employ this into different labs that required an immense amount of dedication as well the understanding of the concepts of how each method work. <br><br>

        Some of the projects I did with JavaScript were:
      <p> 
        <ul>â€¢TicTacToc Game</ul>
        <ul>â€¢Card Games</ul>
       <ul>â€¢Basic snake game</ul> 
        <ul>â€¢Ping pong Game</ul>
        <ul>â€¢Change of number luck game</ul>
      </p>
       
      
        These were some of the many projects I did over the course of high school. I also was part of the Migrant Education program where we took place into a competition to do robot fight that consisted into program a robot to defeat the other teams. This took place at the California State University of Cal Poly Pomona where students from many schools came together to take the challenge of programming and see which school was better. And Yet I successfully completed the task of taking my team to winning the trophy for programming.
<br><br>

        Overall, I had been experiences into different jobs where I had learn skills such as customer service, and being more organized. Yet this is not the only benefits to this but being able to develop critical thinking skills where you have you be caple of putting your mind onto the spot to comeup with the proper way to solve something. My past experiences consisted into 2 different jobs that helped me gain those skills such as; Restaurant, and now working in Costruction. Just being able to gain experiences from different places helps you build your skills as well a future to put yourself into a resume. I look forward to work with companies such as Microsoft, Apple, or Intel, Boing, in which they really caught my attention by the feature they bring into the moder technology, and being able to see your work reflected by your own proper creation might be one of the greatest things ever someone could have done. Also just by people admiring your work, and dedication you put into something makes yourself be more grateful for all the had work you had been able to accomplish throught out your sleepless nights, and what really motivates you to do what you do.Lastly I want to promote self capabilities everyone is able to do even from any where, it doesnt matter who you are, or the importance of your background it matters how you take the next steps of your life and see the difference between those who really want to be able to provide something for their life and the ones that dont. I look forward to work with anyone, and hopefully be able to provide them advice as well learn from eachother so see resources in which both individuals can work on as a team.<br><br>
